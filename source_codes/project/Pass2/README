This pass takes information about shared variables found in loadModStore pass
(possible approximation targets) and finds more information about these values for
the other pass

Specifically, the information found includes:
> identifying the allocation sites for the shared variable
> identifying lock, unlock points
> identifying the merge operation
> identifying the points where threads are spawned

THe API of this pass is similar to the previous pass. The following functions can
be used to find the location in code of each of the afore mentioned information for
each shared variable (allocation site, merge points, etc) 

> std::vector<Instruction* > *getDuplicationPoints()
> std::vector<Instruction* > *getMergePoints()
> std::vector<Instruction* > *getInitPoints()
> std::vector<Instruction* > *getLockPoints()
> std::vector<Instruction* > *getUnlockPoints()
